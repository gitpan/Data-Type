Revision history for Perl extension Data::Type.

0.01  Wed Jul  3 19:19:46 2002
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-n Data::Type -X

0.01.01

  Migrated from 'Data::Verify' to 'Data::Type' namespace
  Removed the pre-alpha disclaimer from README
  This now is alpha software

  added IType::W3C Interface where types from http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/ are implemented
  changed 'Function' namespace to 'Facet' conforming w3c
  
  added HEX, BINARY types

0.01.02

  * Introduced various changes, thanks to https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1930
    posted by Henrik Tougaard via RT

    - 'DATE' type now accepts parameters DATE( [ 'MYSQL','DATEPARSE' ] ) where MYSQL (default) is the
	mysql builtin data type behaviour and DATAPARSE leads to Data::Parse's str2time function use.
	- Introduced locale support (added empty package Data::Type::Locale)
	- separated localizable type parameters to methods, so they are overridable through inheriting
	localized types:
	
	Example Type::dk_yesno vs Type::yesno (snipped sourcecode):

	{
	package Type::yesno;

		our @ISA = qw(IType::String);
	
		sub info 
		{	
			my $this = shift;
					
			return sprintf q{a simple answer (%s)}, join( ', ', $this->choice ) ;
		}
	
		sub choice { qw(yes no) }
	
	package Type::dk_yesno;

		our @ISA = qw(Type::yesno);
		
		sub export { qw(DK::YESNO) };
			
		sub choice { qw(mand kvinde) }
	}
	
  * Export names for types are now accessible via 'export' method ( dk_yesno => DK::YESNO for instance ).
	
  * Types now have their own $VERSION
  
  * Some minor changes
    - rename IType:: info() to desc() for better distinguishing in toc(), because of a bug during
      @ISA traversal and IType:: identification (added _unique_ordered for using only unique desc's). 
    - toc() now lists also export alias's
    - regex's are now centralized and accessible via Regex::list( 'key' );

0.01.03
  
  * Changed the Data::Type::Guard attribute 'types' to 'allow', because was ambiguous with types per se.
  
  * New group IType::Business (see toc).

  * Some minor changes
   - toc() now sorts types alphanumeretically
   - IType:: Groups also get version
   - added type version number to catalog() output
  
0.01.04

  * added dverify( ) which is die'ing instead of throwing exceptions to the people:
  
        dverify( $email, EMAIL ) or die $!;
	
  * renamed 'choice' method for Type:: types to 'param'.
  
  * Some minor changes
    - Type::* package now supports new method C< sub depends {qw(CPAN::aModule)} > for retrieval of
	a dependency tree, which type made Data::Type require what.
	- added Data::Verify::depends() which returns a dependency list for types requiring other modules.
	
  * New (or updated) types:

  DEFINED         0.01.04  - a defined (not undef) value
  DOMAIN          0.01.04  - a network domain name
  IP              0.01.04  - an IP (V4, V6, MAC) network address
  PORT            0.01.04  - a network port number
