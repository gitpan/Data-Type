NAME

Data::Type - versatile data/type verification, validation and testing

VERSION

0.01.02 (Sun Jan 12 08:00:30 2003)

DESCRIPTION

This module supports types. Out of the ordinary it supports parameterised types (like
databases have i.e. VARCHAR(80) ). When you try to feed a typed variable against some
odd data, this module explains what he would have expected. It doesnt support casting (yet).

Backend was realized with Regexp::Common, Email::Valid and Business::CreditCard.

  STRIP              - strip
  UC                 - upper cases

GROUPED TOC

 Logic
  CREDITCARD, REF

 Database
   Logic
      ENUM, SET

   Time or Date related
      DATE, DATETIME, TIME, TIMESTAMP, YEAR

   String
      LONGTEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, TEXT, TINYTEXT

 W3C
   String
      BINARY, HEX

 Numeric
  BOOL, INT, NUM, REAL

 String
  DK::YESNO, EMAIL, GENDER, IP, QUOTED, URI, VARCHAR, WORD, YESNO


GROUP Database
These are types from the mysql database builtin types.

CREDITCARD

This type isn't tested at all and nobody should rely on it.

Supported are: 'Diners Club', 'Australian BankCard', 'VISA', 'Discover/Novus', 'JCB', 'MasterCard', 'Carte Blache', 'American Express'. 
They are parameterised as: DINERS, BANKCARD, VISA, DISCOVER, JCB, MASTERCARD, BLACHE, AMEX.

EXAMPLES

Look in the t directory (of the release) for examples. Here a very simple one:

use Data::Type qw(:all);
use Error qw(:try);

	try
	{
		verify( 'muenalan<at>cpan.org' , EMAIL );
		
		print "email valid";
	}
	catch Type::Exception with
	{
		print "this is not an email";
	};

LAST CHANGES 0.01.02

  * Introduced various changes, thanks to https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1930
    posted by Henrik Tougaard via RT

    - 'DATE' type now accepts parameters DATE( [ 'MYSQL','DATEPARSE' ] ) where MYSQL (default) is the
	mysql builtin data type behaviour and DATAPARSE leads to Data::Parse's str2time function use.
	- Introduced locale support (added empty package Data::Type::Locale)
	- separated localizable type parameters to methods, so they are overridable through inheriting
	localized types:
	
	Example Type::dk_yesno vs Type::yesno (snipped sourcecode):

	{
	package Type::yesno;

		our @ISA = qw(IType::String);
	
		sub info 
		{	
			my $this = shift;
					
			return sprintf q{a simple answer (%s)}, join( ', ', $this->choice ) ;
		}
	
		sub choice { qw(yes no) }
	
	package Type::dk_yesno;

		our @ISA = qw(Type::yesno);
		
		sub export { qw(DK::YESNO) };
			
		sub choice { qw(mand kvinde) }
	}
	
  * Export names for types are now accessible via 'export' method ( dk_yesno => DK::YESNO for instance ).
	
  * Types now have their own $VERSION
  
  * Some minor changes
    - rename IType:: info() to desc() for better distinguishing in toc(), because of a bug during
      @ISA traversal and IType:: identification (added _unique_ordered for using only unique desc's). 
    - toc() now lists also export alias's
    - regex's are now centralized and accessible via Regex::list( 'key' );
